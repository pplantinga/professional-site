I recently began my first semester as a PhD student at OSU. I'm taking lots of classes, and it looks like all of them are actually statistics in disguise. "Artificial Intelligence"? Try "Statistical Intelligence". "Computational Linguistics"? Try "Statistical Linguistics"."Statistics"? Oh wait, that's supposed to be Statistics. The only one that hasn't had much statistics yet is Programming Languages, but I'm sure it will get there soon.

I thought I was in school for a computer science degree, not a statistics degree!
